## What is Delta-Neutral Hedging?

Delta-neutral hedging is a sophisticated strategy that maintains USDsd's peg to the US dollar while generating yield. Standard Money's algorithms automatically execute these trades by holding long positions in crypto assets and equivalent short positions in perpetual futures to create a delta-neutral position.

## How It Works

### The Delta-Neutral Mechanism

<Steps>
  <Step title="Crypto Asset Collateral">
    USDsd is backed by crypto assets like ETH, BTC, and stablecoins held as
    collateral
  </Step>
  <Step title="Long Position Management">
    Maintain long positions in the underlying crypto assets to provide
    collateral backing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Short Futures Hedging">
    Simultaneously hold equivalent short positions in perpetual futures to hedge
    price exposure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funding Rate Collection">
    Collect positive funding rates from short positions when markets are in
    contango
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yield Distribution">
    Revenue from funding rates and staking rewards is distributed to sUSDsd
    holders
  </Step>
</Steps>

- **Peak Performance**: Up to 30% during high volatility periods
- **Consistency**: Stable returns across different market conditions
- **Uptime**: 99.9% operational availability

### Monitoring Tools

## Getting Started

To benefit from delta-neutral hedging yields:

1. **Acquire USDsd**: Buy USDsd on DEXs or swap USDT/USDC using the app widget
2. **Stake for sUSDsd**: Convert USDsd to sUSDsd to start earning rewards
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track your rewards in the app dashboard

<Info>
  The delta-neutral hedging strategy runs automatically in the background. As a
  sUSDsd holder, you simply earn the generated yields from staking rewards and
  funding rates without needing to manage positions yourself.
