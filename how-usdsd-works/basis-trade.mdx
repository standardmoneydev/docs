## What is Basis Trading?

Basis trading is a sophisticated strategy that exploits price differences between spot and perpetual futures markets. Standard Money's algorithms automatically execute these trades to generate consistent yields for USDsd holders.

## How It Works

### The Basis Trade Mechanism

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spot Market Analysis">
    Our algorithms continuously monitor spot prices of major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) across multiple exchanges
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perpetual Futures Monitoring">
    Simultaneously track perpetual futures prices on exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit
  </Step>
  <Step title="Arbitrage Opportunity Detection">
    Identify when the basis (price difference) between spot and futures exceeds profitable thresholds
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Execution">
    Execute simultaneous long spot and short futures positions to capture the basis spread
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yield Distribution">
    Profits from successful basis trades are distributed to sUSDsd holders as rewards
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Benefits

### Consistent Yield Generation
- **Market Neutral**: Profits from price differences, not directional bets
- **Low Risk**: Hedged positions reduce exposure to market volatility
- **Automated**: 24/7 operation without manual intervention

### Exchange Integration
Our algorithms are integrated with major exchanges:
- **Binance**: Largest crypto exchange with deep liquidity
- **OKX**: Advanced derivatives platform
- **Bybit**: Professional trading infrastructure

## Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Sub-second price tracking across exchanges
- **Risk Management**: Automated position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms
- **Slippage Control**: Smart order routing to minimize execution costs
- **Liquidity Management**: Dynamic allocation based on market conditions

### Yield Optimization
- **Compound Strategy**: Reinvested profits increase future earning potential
- **Multi-Asset**: Diversified across BTC, ETH, and other major cryptocurrencies
- **Market Adaptation**: Algorithms adjust to changing market conditions

## Risk Considerations

<Warning>
  While basis trading is generally lower risk than directional trading, it's not risk-free. Market conditions can affect profitability.
</Warning>

### Potential Risks
- **Exchange Risk**: Technical issues or regulatory changes at exchanges
- **Liquidity Risk**: Temporary inability to execute trades at optimal prices
- **Basis Risk**: Unfavorable basis movements that reduce profitability
- **Execution Risk**: Slippage or failed trades due to network congestion

### Risk Mitigation
- **Multi-Exchange**: Diversified across multiple platforms
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous oversight of all positions
- **Automated Stops**: Built-in risk management protocols
- **Reserve Fund**: Protocol maintains reserves for unexpected losses

## Performance Metrics

### Historical Performance
- **Average Yield**: 8% annualized (current)
- **Peak Performance**: Up to 30% during high volatility periods
- **Consistency**: Stable returns across different market conditions
- **Uptime**: 99.9% operational availability

### Monitoring Tools
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Track current positions and performance
- **Historical Analytics**: Review past performance and trends
- **Yield Calculator**: Estimate potential returns based on current market conditions

## Getting Started

To benefit from basis trading yields:

1. **Mint USDsd**: Convert your USDT to USDsd
2. **Stake for sUSDsd**: Convert USDsd to sUSDsd to start earning
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track your rewards in the app dashboard

<Info>
  The basis trading strategy runs automatically in the background. As a sUSDsd holder, you simply earn the generated yields without needing to manage trades yourself.
