  better alternative to traditional stablecoins with yield generation
  capabilities.

## How USDsd Maintains Its Peg

USDsd maintains its 1:1 peg to the US dollar through a sophisticated delta-neutral strategy that combines crypto asset collateral with derivatives hedging:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Crypto Asset Collateral">
    USDsd is backed by crypto assets like ETH, BTC, and stablecoins (USDT, USDC)
    held as collateral
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delta-Neutral Hedging">
    Simultaneously holds long positions in crypto assets and equivalent short
    positions in perpetual futures
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price Stability">
    Fluctuations in crypto asset prices are offset by corresponding gains/losses
    in short positions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yield Generation">
    Revenue generated from staking rewards and positive funding rates on short
    positions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Distribution">
    All generated yield is distributed to sUSDsd holders as rewards
  </Step>
</Steps>
