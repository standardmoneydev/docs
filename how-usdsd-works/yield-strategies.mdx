## Overview

Standard Money employs multiple sophisticated yield strategies to generate returns for sUSDsd holders. These strategies work together to provide consistent, high-yield opportunities while maintaining liquidity and minimizing risk.

## Primary Yield Sources

### 1. Basis Trading (Primary Strategy)

**How it works**: Exploits price differences between spot and perpetual futures markets
- **Target Yield**: 8-15% annually
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Liquidity**: High (24/7 access)

<Info>
  Basis trading is our core strategy, providing the majority of yield generation through automated arbitrage between spot and futures markets.
</Info>

### 2. Liquidity Provision

**How it works**: Provides liquidity to perpetual order books on major exchanges
- **Target Yield**: 5-12% annually
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Liquidity**: High

### 3. Cross-Exchange Arbitrage

**How it works**: Capitalizes on price differences between exchanges
- **Target Yield**: 3-8% annually
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Liquidity**: High

### 4. Volatility Harvesting

**How it works**: Generates returns during high market volatility periods
- **Target Yield**: 10-30% annually (variable)
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Liquidity**: High

## Yield Optimization Features

### Dynamic Allocation
Our algorithms automatically adjust capital allocation based on:
- **Market Conditions**: Favor strategies with better risk-adjusted returns
- **Volatility Levels**: Increase allocation to volatility strategies during high-vol periods
- **Liquidity Requirements**: Maintain sufficient liquidity for redemptions
- **Risk Metrics**: Continuously monitor and adjust risk exposure

### Compound Growth
- **Automatic Reinvestment**: All yields are automatically compounded
- **No Manual Action**: Your sUSDsd balance grows automatically
- **Real-time Updates**: See your balance increase in real-time
