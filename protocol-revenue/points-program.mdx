## Overview

Our rewards program recognizes and rewards users who actively participate in the Standard Money ecosystem. By completing key actions, you can earn points that will directly influence your eligibility and allocation in our upcoming airdrop. The points you accumulate will determine your airdrop tier, with users earning higher point totals receiving larger shares of the airdrop.

## How to Earn Points

You can earn points through staking USDsd, referring friends, social media engagement, and reaching various milestones. The most significant point earning comes from staking USDsd in our yield pools. Standard Yield Pool offers basic point earning for any amount staked, while Boost Yield Pool provides enhanced point multipliers but requires staking in Standard Yield Pool at a 1:10 ratio first.

When you refer a friend to the platform, you'll earn 10% of all points they accumulate once they reach the 200-point threshold. This means if your referred friend earns 500 points total, you receive 50 points, and you continue earning 10% of their future points as well. You can refer as many people as you want, with the 10% bonus applying individually to each qualifying referral.

Social media engagement through sharing content, following our accounts on X and Telegram, and participating in community discussions also earns points. Additionally, reaching milestones such as staking for 30 days, consistent platform visits, and achieving volume thresholds provides bonus point multipliers.

## Access Requirements

Standard Yield Pool is accessible to all users with no minimum stake requirements, allowing you to start earning points immediately with any amount of USDsd. Boost Yield Pool offers higher rewards and enhanced point earning but requires staking in Standard Yield Pool at a 1:10 ratio. For example, to stake 100 USDsd in Boost Yield Pool, you need 1,000 USDsd staked in Standard Yield Pool first.

## Why It Matters

The points system ensures fair distribution of airdrop rewards based on actual participation and contribution to the ecosystem. Users who start earning early and participate actively will benefit most, as every action counts toward your airdrop allocation. The system rewards long-term commitment and genuine engagement with the Standard Money platform.
