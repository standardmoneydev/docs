title: "Rewards Mechanism"
description: "How the protocol generates and distributes rewards to sUSDsd holders"
---

## Overview

The Standard Money protocol employs a sophisticated rewards mechanism that automatically generates and distributes yields to sUSDsd holders. This system ensures fair, transparent, and sustainable reward distribution while maintaining protocol stability.

## Revenue Generation

### Primary Revenue Sources

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basis Trading Profits">
    Revenue from automated basis trading between spot and futures markets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Liquidity Provision Fees">
    Fees earned from providing liquidity on perpetual order books
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cross-Exchange Arbitrage">
    Profits from price differences between exchanges
  </Step>
  <Step title="Volatility Harvesting">
    Returns generated during high market volatility periods
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Revenue Distribution Model

**sUSDsd Holders**: 85% of all generated revenue
**Protocol Treasury**: 10% for development and operations
**Reserve Fund**: 5% for risk management and emergency situations

<Info>
  The majority of protocol revenue (85%) is distributed directly to sUSDsd holders, ensuring maximum value accrual for participants.
</Info>

## Rewards Distribution

### Automatic Distribution
- **Real-time Accrual**: Rewards accrue continuously and are automatically added to your sUSDsd balance
- **No Manual Claiming**: No need to manually claim rewards - they compound automatically
- **Transparent Calculation**: All reward calculations are transparent and verifiable on-chain

### Distribution Frequency
- **Continuous**: Rewards are added to your balance in real-time
- **No Lock-up**: Rewards are immediately available (though staying staked maximizes compound growth)
- **Compound Effect**: Rewards automatically compound, increasing your future earning potential

## Reward Calculation

### Base Reward Rate
The base reward rate is determined by:
- **Protocol Performance**: Actual revenue generated by trading strategies
- **Market Conditions**: Current market volatility and trading opportunities
- **Total Staked**: Amount of USDsd staked as sUSDsd
- **Reserve Requirements**: Amount held in reserve for risk management

### Dynamic Adjustment
- **Performance-Based**: Rewards adjust based on actual protocol performance
- **Market Responsive**: Rates increase during high-volatility periods
- **Sustainable**: Rates are set to ensure long-term protocol sustainability

## Revenue Tracking

### Real-time Metrics
- **Daily Revenue**: Track daily protocol revenue generation
- **Yield Rate**: Current annualized yield rate for sUSDsd
- **Total Distributed**: Cumulative rewards distributed to holders
- **Reserve Levels**: Current protocol reserve fund levels
