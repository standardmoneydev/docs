title: "Rewards Mechanism"
description: "How the protocol generates and distributes rewards to sUSDsd holders"
---

## Overview

The Standard Money protocol employs a sophisticated rewards mechanism that automatically generates and distributes yields to sUSDsd holders. This system ensures fair, transparent, and sustainable reward distribution while maintaining protocol stability. The mechanism operates through multiple revenue streams that work together to provide consistent returns while managing risk effectively.

## Revenue Generation

The protocol generates revenue through four primary sources that work in combination to provide stable and sustainable yields. Staking rewards form the foundational yield component, generated from staked crypto assets like stETH and stBTC in Proof-of-Stake networks. This provides a stable base yield of 3-8% annually, similar to how traditional bonds provide base returns in a portfolio.

Funding rate arbitrage represents the primary revenue source, where the protocol maintains short positions in perpetual futures contracts that historically exhibit positive funding rates. This delta-neutral strategy generates 8-20% annually and represents the core of our yield generation approach. The protocol also engages in basis trading, exploiting price differences between spot and perpetual futures markets through automated arbitrage, and cross-exchange arbitrage, capitalizing on price differences between exchanges.

### Revenue Distribution Model

**sUSDsd Holders**: 85% of all generated revenue
**Protocol Treasury**: 10% for development and operations  
**Reserve Fund**: 5% for risk management and emergency situations

<Info>
  The majority of protocol revenue (85%) is distributed directly to sUSDsd
  holders, ensuring maximum value accrual for participants.

## Rewards Distribution

Rewards are distributed automatically and continuously to sUSDsd holders through a transparent, on-chain mechanism. The system operates in real-time, with rewards accruing continuously and being automatically added to your sUSDsd balance without requiring manual claiming. This automatic compounding effect means your sUSDsd amount increases over time, and the new rewards immediately begin earning additional rewards themselves.

The distribution frequency is continuous, with rewards added to your balance in real-time as they are generated by the protocol's trading activities. While rewards are immediately available (though staying staked maximizes compound growth), the automatic compounding creates an exponential growth effect that becomes increasingly significant over longer holding periods.

## Reward Calculation

The base reward rate is determined by several key factors that ensure sustainable and fair distribution. Protocol performance, measured by actual revenue generated by trading strategies, forms the foundation of reward calculations. Market conditions, including current volatility levels and trading opportunities, also influence the rate, with higher volatility generally leading to increased revenue generation.

The total amount of USDsd staked as sUSDsd affects the per-token reward rate, as rewards are distributed proportionally among all stakers. Reserve requirements, representing the amount held in reserve for risk management, also factor into the calculation to ensure long-term protocol sustainability.

The system employs dynamic adjustment mechanisms that respond to changing conditions. Rewards adjust based on actual protocol performance rather than fixed rates, ensuring that distributions reflect real revenue generation. During high-volatility periods, rates may increase as trading opportunities expand, while the system maintains sustainable rates that ensure long-term protocol viability.

## Revenue Tracking and Performance

The protocol provides comprehensive tracking of revenue generation and distribution through real-time metrics and historical performance data. Users can monitor daily protocol revenue generation, current annualized yield rates for sUSDsd, cumulative rewards distributed to holders, and current protocol reserve fund levels.

Historical performance data shows the protocol's track record across different market conditions. The system has demonstrated resilience and consistent performance, with yield rates adapting to market conditions while maintaining overall sustainability. The diversified revenue approach helps smooth out volatility and provides more predictable returns over time.

## Protocol Sustainability

The protocol implements several mechanisms to ensure long-term sustainability and stability. Reserve management plays a crucial role, with 5% of all revenue allocated to an emergency reserve fund that protects against unexpected losses and market downturns. This reserve buffer ensures the protocol can weather challenging periods while maintaining operations and reward distributions.

Treasury allocation of 10% of revenue funds ongoing development, operational costs, and infrastructure improvements. This investment in the protocol's future ensures continued innovation and growth while maintaining the high percentage of revenue distributed to holders.

## Transparency and Risk Management

All protocol activities maintain complete transparency through on-chain operations. Every transaction and distribution is recorded on the blockchain, making all reward calculations and distributions verifiable by anyone. This transparency builds trust and allows for complete audit trails of all protocol activities.

Risk management is built into the system through diversified revenue sources that reduce overall volatility. The reserve fund provides stability during low-revenue periods, while adaptive strategies allow algorithms to adjust to changing market conditions. Conservative projections and regular stress testing ensure that reward mechanisms remain sustainable even under extreme market conditions.

## User Benefits

For sUSDsd holders, the system provides passive income generation without requiring active management. The automatic compounding effect maximizes returns over time, while full transparency provides visibility into reward generation and distribution. Users maintain flexibility to enter and exit anytime with no lock-up periods, though staying staked maximizes the benefits of compound growth.

The protocol benefits from this alignment of interests, as revenue sharing incentivizes long-term participation and creates sustainable growth. The community alignment ensures that user and protocol interests remain aligned, while network effects mean that more participants improve overall performance for everyone.

## Getting Started

To begin earning rewards, users should first mint USDsd by converting USDT, then stake their USDsd to receive sUSDsd tokens that automatically start earning rewards. The dashboard provides real-time tracking of rewards and performance, allowing users to monitor their progress and the benefits of compound growth.

Maximizing rewards involves long-term holding to benefit from compound growth, staying staked to avoid frequent unstaking that reduces returns, and using the dashboard to track progress and understand the system's performance. The earlier and longer you participate, the more you benefit from the exponential effects of compound growth.
