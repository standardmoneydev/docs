## What are sUSDsd Rewards?

sUSDsd (staked USDsd) is the reward-earning version of USDsd. When you stake your USDsd to receive sUSDsd, you automatically start earning rewards from the protocol's revenue-generating activities.

## How sUSDsd Works

### The Staking Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mint USDsd">
    First, convert your USDT to USDsd through the protocol
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake for sUSDsd">
    Convert your USDsd to sUSDsd to start earning rewards
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Rewards">
    Your sUSDsd balance automatically grows as rewards are added
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unstake Anytime">
    Convert sUSDsd back to USDsd whenever you want
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Features
- **No Lock-up Period**: Enter and exit anytime
- **Automatic Compounding**: Rewards compound automatically
- **Real-time Growth**: See your balance grow in real-time
- **Transparent**: All reward calculations are on-chain and verifiable

## Reward Mechanics

### How Rewards Are Calculated

Your sUSDsd rewards are calculated based on:
- **Your Stake Amount**: The amount of sUSDsd you hold
- **Protocol Performance**: Revenue generated by trading strategies
- **Time Staked**: Longer staking periods benefit from compound growth
- **Market Conditions**: Rewards vary based on market opportunities

### Reward Distribution
- **Continuous Accrual**: Rewards are added continuously, not in batches
- **Automatic Compounding**: New rewards are immediately added to your stake
- **No Manual Action**: No need to claim or reinvest rewards
- **Immediate Availability**: Rewards are available immediately (though staying staked maximizes growth)

## Maximizing Your Rewards

### Compound Growth Strategy

The power of compound growth becomes significant over time:

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Early">
    The earlier you start staking, the more time your rewards have to compound
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stay Staked">
    Avoid frequent unstaking to maximize compound growth
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reinvest Rewards">
    Let your sUSDsd balance grow automatically through compounding
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Use the dashboard to track your reward performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Your Rewards

### Real-time Tracking
- **Live Balance**: See your sUSDsd balance update in real-time
- **Reward History**: Track your reward accrual over time
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor your personal yield performance
- **Compound Effect**: Visualize how compounding affects your growth

### Reward Calculation Example

If you stake 1,000 USDsd for sUSDsd:
- **Day 1**: 1,000 sUSDsd
- **Day 30**: ~1,012 sUSDsd (1.2% monthly yield)
- **Day 365**: ~1,153 sUSDsd (15.3% annual yield)

<Note>
  These are example calculations. Actual rewards depend on protocol performance and market conditions.
</Note>

## Risk Considerations

### Reward Volatility
- **Market Dependent**: Rewards vary based on market conditions
- **No Guarantees**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- **Risk Management**: Protocol maintains reserves for stability

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Diversified Revenue**: Multiple income sources reduce volatility
- **Reserve Fund**: Protocol maintains reserves for stability
- **Conservative Projections**: Reward rates based on sustainable estimates

## Tax Considerations

### Reward Classification
- **Income**: sUSDsd rewards may be considered income for tax purposes
- **Compound Growth**: Reinvested rewards may have different tax implications
- **Documentation**: Keep records of all staking and unstaking activities

<Warning>
  Tax treatment of crypto rewards varies by jurisdiction. Consult a tax professional for advice specific to your situation.
</Warning>
