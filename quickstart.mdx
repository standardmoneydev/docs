## Welcome to Standard Money

Standard Money is a synthetic dollar protocol that makes USDT what it was always meant to be. This guide will help you get started with minting, staking, and earning with USDsd and sUSDsd.

## What is USDsd?

USDsd is a synthetic, collateralized version of Tether that provides a stable and scalable solution to the trader market. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDsd offers high yield potential of up to 30% annual returns, no lock-up periods allowing you to enter and exit anytime, and advanced basis trade strategies that use algorithms to short perps and long spot simultaneously.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Visit the [Standard Money App](https://www.app.standardmoney.com)
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Ensure you have USDT or USDC for swapping to USDsd

### Step 2: Get USDsd

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Method">
    You can get USDsd using the **Swap Widget** in the app.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Confirm">

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Stake USDsd (Optional)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Staking">Go to the staking section in the app</Step>
  <Step title="Stake Your USDsd">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Rewards">
    Track your sUSDsd balance and accumulated rewards
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Rewards

### sUSDsd Rewards

When you stake USDsd to receive sUSDsd, you earn rewards from basis trade yields generated through perpetual futures trading on exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit. Additionally, you benefit from liquidity provision rewards from providing liquidity on perpetual order books, and protocol revenue that is distributed to sUSDsd holders.

<Info>
  Rewards are automatically compounded into your sUSDsd balance, meaning your
  sUSDsd amount increases over time. Current yield is 8% with potential for up
  to 30% annual returns.

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Always verify you're on the official Standard Money app at standardmoney.com
  before connecting your wallet or making transactions.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

- **Start small**: Begin with a small amount to familiarize yourself with the protocol
- **Keep private keys secure**: Never share your wallet's private keys or seed phrase
- **Monitor positions**: Regularly check your USDsd/sUSDsd balance and rewards

It's essential to understand the risks involved before participating. We recommend reviewing the comprehensive risk documentation to make informed decisions about your participation in the protocol.
