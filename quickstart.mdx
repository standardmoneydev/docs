## Welcome to Standard Money

Standard Money is a synthetic dollar protocol that makes USDT what it was always meant to be. This guide will help you get started with minting, staking, and earning with USDsd and sUSDsd.

## What is USDsd?

USDsd is a synthetic, collateralized version of Tether that provides a stable and scalable solution to the trader market. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDsd offers high yield potential of up to 30% annual returns, no lock-up periods allowing you to enter and exit anytime, and advanced basis trade strategies that use algorithms to short perps and long spot simultaneously.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Visit the Standard Money App
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Ensure you have USDT or USDC for swapping to USDsd

## Understanding Rewards

### sUSDsd Rewards

When you stake USDsd to receive sUSDsd, you earn rewards from basis trade yields generated through perpetual futures trading on exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit. Additionally, you benefit from liquidity provision rewards from providing liquidity on perpetual order books, and protocol revenue that is distributed to sUSDsd holders.

<Info>
  Rewards are automatically compounded into your sUSDsd balance, meaning your
  sUSDsd amount increases over time. Current yield is 8% with potential for up
  to 30% annual returns.

## Points Program

### Overview

Our rewards program is designed to recognize and reward users who actively participate in the Standard Money ecosystem. By completing key actions, you can earn points that will directly influence your eligibility and allocation in our upcoming airdrop.

### How to Earn Points

You can earn points through the following activities:

- **Staking USDsd**: Stake in our yield strategies (Boost Yield Pool offers higher rewards)
- **Referring Friends**: Once a referred user earns 200 points or more, you'll receive 10% of all the points they generate, continuously
- **Social Media Engagement**: Share and follow on social media, including X and Telegram
- **Long-term Staking**: Stake for longer periods to unlock multipliers that significantly boost your staking rewards
- **Milestones**: Reach milestones such as staking for 30 days or visiting the platform consistently

<Info>
  The more value you bring to the ecosystem, the more points you'll earn. Check
  your dashboard to track your points and progress.
</Info>

### Referrals System

**How It Works**: When you refer a friend and they start using the platform, you will earn 10% of all points they accumulate, as long as they meet the minimum activity threshold.

**Requirements**: The referred user must collect at least 200 points before the referral bonus activates. Once they pass 200 points, you begin receiving 10% of every point they earn — automatically tracked and added to your total.

**Example**: If your friend earns 500 points total, you receive 10% of 500 = 50 points. If they continue earning more, you continue earning too.

<Warning>
  You will not receive any referral points if the referred user collects fewer
  than 200 points. You can refer as many people as you like — the 10% applies
  individually per qualifying referral.
</Warning>

### Staking Rewards

**Standard Yield Pool**: Basic points earning for staking USDsd
**Boost Yield Pool**: Enhanced points earning for staking USDsd (requires 1:10 ratio with Standard Yield Pool)

The longer you stake and the more you stake, the more points you earn.

### Why It Matters

The points you accumulate will determine your airdrop tier. Users with higher point totals will receive a larger share of the airdrop. This system ensures that rewards are distributed fairly, based on your contributions and long-term engagement.

<Info>
  Start earning early and participate actively — every action counts toward your
  airdrop allocation.
</Info>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Always verify you're on the official Standard Money app at standardmoney.com
  before connecting your wallet or making transactions.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

- **Start small**: Begin with a small amount to familiarize yourself with the protocol
- **Keep private keys secure**: Never share your wallet's private keys or seed phrase
- **Monitor positions**: Regularly check your USDsd/sUSDsd balance and rewards

It's essential to understand the risks involved before participating. We recommend reviewing the protocol documentation and FAQ to make informed decisions about your participation in the protocol.
