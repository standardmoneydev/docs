# USDsd Terms and Conditions - EEA

These Terms and Conditions Apply to Users in the European Economic Area

Effective January 01, 2025

## Interpretation

In these Terms:

"Applicable Laws" means all relevant laws and regulations.
"Blockchains" refers to blockchain networks where Tokens are distributed, such as Ethereum.
"Business Day" is any day commercial banks operate.
"Greenlisted" means successfully completing onboarding and KYC/AML requirements.
"KYC/AML Requirements" are compliance processes for identity verification.
"Tokenholder" is anyone holding the private key to a Token.

## KYC/AML Requirements and Onboarding (Greenlisting)

Users must complete onboarding and KYC/AML procedures, including submitting identity documents, proof of residence, source of funds, and entity details where applicable. Users must also provide at least one blockchain wallet address for Token transfers. Users must promptly update provided information as necessary.

## Properties of the Tokens

Tokens maintain stable value approximating USD by employing delta-neutral hedging strategies using reserve assets such as Ethereum or Bitcoin provided by Greenlisted users. Tokens are digital, blockchain-based units without inherent financial returns or investment value.

## Ordering and Delivery

Users require a compatible blockchain wallet and may acquire Tokens by submitting a purchase request via our website, specifying their intended purchase amount and blockchain wallet address. Payment must be made immediately upon order acceptance.

## Listing and Trading of Tokens

Tokens may be traded on centralized exchanges or directly via blockchain-based peer-to-peer platforms. The Issuer does not guarantee ongoing listing or trading.

## Exercise of Rights

Only Greenlisted Tokenholders may exercise Token-related rights. Tokenholders are responsible for private key security and bear full liability for key loss or theft.

## Redemption

Tokenholders may redeem Tokens for the equivalent asset reserve value, adjusted for market conditions and blockchain costs. Token redemptions may require further identity verification. Withdrawal details must be accurate; incorrect details provided by users absolve the Issuer of responsibility.

## Limited Recourse

No personal liability for obligations under these Terms shall attach to the Issuer's shareholders, officers, or agents, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

## Smart Contract Modifications

The underlying smart contract may be modified by the Issuer solely to address security, rectify errors, or implement necessary updates consistent with these Terms. Tokenholders will be notified of material changes.

## Issuer Substitution

The Issuer may replace itself with another entity under its full control, provided such entity fulfills all obligations under these Terms. Notice will be provided to Tokenholders.

## No Set-off

Neither party may set off claims against the other related to the Tokens.

## Corrections and Amendments

The Issuer may correct obvious errors or amend Terms if reasonably acceptable to Tokenholders. Notifications will be issued to Tokenholders.

## Notices

All notices will be communicated via the Issuer's website.

## Taxes

Payments under these Terms will be made without deduction unless required by law. Users should seek independent tax advice.

## Intellectual Property

The Issuer retains all intellectual property rights in its products and content. Users receive a limited license for usage in compliance with these Terms.

## Liability Limitations

The Issuer's liability is limited to damages arising from gross negligence or intentional misconduct. The Issuer is not liable for third-party actions outside its direct control.

## Non-Custodial, No Fiduciary Duty

The Issuer never holds custody of users' digital assets. Users are solely responsible for wallet security. No fiduciary duties are established by these Terms.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany. Jurisdiction for disputes lies exclusively with competent courts at the Issuer's registered office.

## Severability

Invalid or unenforceable Terms will not affect remaining provisions.

## Miscellaneous

These Terms may change periodically, with notices communicated via the provided contact methods. Users not objecting within two months are deemed to have accepted such changes. Users have the right to terminate these Terms without penalty if changes are unacceptable.

# USDsd Terms and Conditions - Non-EEA

These Terms and Conditions Apply to Users Outside the European Economic Area

Last Updated: January 2025

By holding or using USDsd tokens issued by Standard Money LLC ("Tokens"), you accept these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). Users who complete our Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks and onboarding processes become "Authorized Users." Users holding Tokens without such onboarding are considered "General Users." Authorized Users and General Users must comply with these Terms. Specific provisions for either user type will be explicitly stated; otherwise, all references apply equally to both.

## About USDsd

USDsd is a digital asset issued by Standard Money LLC and represents stored value without granting rights to profits, ownership, or governance. USDsd tokens are backed by crypto asset reserves (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL, stablecoins like USDC, USDT) held securely by an independent third-party entity unaffiliated with Standard Money LLC. Holding USDsd does not entitle holders to interest or profits from the reserves.

## Scope and Usage

Authorized Users can mint USDsd by exchanging approved digital assets with Standard Money LLC and redeem USDsd back into approved assets. General Users cannot redeem USDsd directly unless they become Authorized Users. Transferring USDsd transfers redemption rights to subsequent holders only if they become Authorized Users.

## Compliance and Restrictions

All USDsd-related activities must comply with applicable laws, including AML and anti-terrorism financing regulations. Users may not be sanctioned individuals, entities, or residents of sanctioned jurisdictions (e.g., Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, or Crimea).

## Eligibility and Limitations

Users must be at least 18 years old and not engage in illegal activities (fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing). U.S. residents cannot become Authorized Users at this time. Standard Money LLC may restrict or terminate services for any user violating these Terms.

## Support

Contact our support team for inquiries or reporting violations related to these Terms.

## Unsupported Assets and Blockchain Forks

Standard Money LLC does not support unofficial copies, wrappers, or forks of USDsd. Users acknowledge risks associated with blockchain forks and accept temporary service disruptions.

## Blockchain Operations and Modifications

USDsd operates on supported blockchains. Standard Money LLC is not liable for blockchain attacks, delays, or other disruptions. Standard Money LLC reserves the right to migrate USDsd tokens to new blockchains or protocols, requiring users' cooperation.

## Privacy

Standard Money LLC is committed to protecting your personal information. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for details.

## Communications

All official communications will be electronic and in English. Translations are provided only for convenience.

## Intellectual Property Rights

Standard Money LLC grants Authorized Users a limited, revocable license to use its services. All associated trademarks, copyrights, and content remain exclusively owned by Standard Money LLC.

## Risks and Disclosures

Standard Money LLC does not guarantee USDsd value stability on third-party exchanges. Users assume risks associated with third-party platforms, irreversible transactions, regulatory changes, and market volatility.

## Fees

Authorized Users may incur transaction costs, disclosed before completion. No additional fees apply to minting or redeeming beyond blockchain transaction costs.

## Currency Conversion

USDsd issuance rates are based on asset values minus applicable transaction fees at issuance.

## Service Adjustments

Standard Money LLC may alter, suspend, or discontinue USDsd services at any time without prior notice.

## Transaction Irreversibility

All transactions involving USDsd are final and irreversible once initiated.

## Restricted Activities

Users must avoid activities violating laws, defrauding others, interfering with services, or transacting with restricted addresses.

## Prohibited Transactions

USDsd may not be used for illegal goods, gambling, money laundering, sanctioned activities, or prohibited market practices. Violation may result in suspension or forfeiture of tokens.

## Taxes

Authorized Users are responsible for taxes related to USDsd transactions.

## Indemnification

Users agree to indemnify Standard Money LLC against claims arising from violations of these Terms or applicable laws.

## Liability and Warranty

USDsd is provided "as is" without warranties. Standard Money LLC is not liable for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages from token usage.

## Force Majeure

Standard Money LLC is not liable for disruptions due to unforeseen circumstances beyond its control.

## Amendments

Standard Money LLC may update these Terms at any time by posting revised versions. Continued usage constitutes acceptance.

## Assignment

Users may not transfer obligations under these Terms. Standard Money LLC may freely assign its rights and obligations.

## Survival

Certain obligations will survive termination of these Terms.

## Third-party Content

Standard Money LLC is not responsible for third-party content or linked websites.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Standard Money LLC is registered.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms represent the complete agreement between Standard Money LLC and users regarding USDsd.

## Electronic Consent

Authorized Users consent to electronic communication for all legal and operational matters. Consent may be withdrawn with appropriate notice.
