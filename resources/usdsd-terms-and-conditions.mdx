## USDsd Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions Apply To All Users

Last Updated: December 2024

Users who have completed Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks, as well as other onboarding procedures, and are whitelisted with Standard Money are referred to herein as a "Mint User." To the extent you have not completed the aforementioned checks or been whitelisted but hold USDsd, these Terms still apply to your holding and use of USDsd (hereinafter referred as "Holding User"). For the avoidance of doubt, Holding Users are not customers of Standard Money.

By obtaining and using USDsd, you understand and expressly agree to these Terms, regardless of whether or not you are a customer of Standard Money, and you acknowledge that you have reviewed and understand each of the disclosures made in this section. Any provisions of these Terms that only apply to Mint Users or Holding Users will be specifically noted herein. Unless so noted, each Section of these Terms apply to both Mint Users and Holding Users, and any use of "you" or "your" refers to both Mint Users and Holding Users.

By holding or using USDsd, or using any of the USDsd Services, you agree that you have read, understood and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy, and you acknowledge and agree that you will be bound by these terms and policies.

Section 22 of these Terms governs how these Terms may be changed over time; the date of the last update is set forth at the top of these Terms.

## 1. About USDsd

USDsd is a digital token issued by Standard Money. USDsd issued by Standard Money is a form of stored value or prepaid access and does not represent a claim, participation interest, economic right, voting right, or other similar right associated with Standard Money or any of its affiliates.

USDsd is backed by an amount of spot crypto assets, such as BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and offsetting hedging positions on derivatives contracts (the "USDsd Reserves"). The protocol maintains USDsd's peg through sophisticated delta-neutral hedging mechanisms and basis trading strategies.

Unaffiliated third parties, including the Standard Money Foundation directly and via the Standard Money Risk Committee, provide input on certain parameters associated with the USDsd Reserves. The Standard Money Foundation does not have any members, ultimate beneficial owners, or beneficiaries, and exists with the principal objects of supporting the Standard Money Protocol and its architecture. No shareholders, employees, contractors, ultimate beneficial owners, or other party affiliated with Standard Money or its affiliates holds a position of ownership or control with respect to the Standard Money Foundation.

USDsd is not designed to intrinsically create returns for holders, increase in value, or otherwise accrue financial benefit to the USDsd holder. However, USDsd can be staked to receive sUSDsd tokens which earn rewards from protocol revenue.

**Important**: Only specific whitelisted users can mint new USDsd tokens directly to prevent supply overinflation and maintain protocol stability. All users can acquire USDsd by purchasing it on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or using the app's swap widget.

## 2. Scope of USDsd and Key Terms

The following only applies to Mint Users: As you have agreed to, and are subject to, the USDsd Mint User Agreement, Standard Money makes available the following USDsd-related Services: (i) create USDsd in exchange for accepted tokens from Standard Money, and (ii) redeem USDsd for supported assets from Standard Money (collectively, the "USDsd Services"). Your use of the USDsd Services is subject to these Terms. Any of the USDsd Services can be discontinued at any time in accordance with Section 14 of these USDsd Terms.

You understand and agree that you may only utilize accepted assets to create USDsd and redeem USDsd directly with Standard Money to the extent that you are a Mint User.

The following only applies to Holding Users: You may not redeem USDsd with Standard Money unless and until you are a Mint User who has cleared KYC/AML and other checks and have onboarded as a whitelisted customer with Standard Money. Eligibility for and requirements related to such process are set forth in the USDsd Mint User Agreement.

The following applies to both Mint Users and Holding Users: Your use of USDsd and USDsd Services (as applicable), is subject to these Terms and Standard Money's obligations hereunder are conditional on you complying with its provisions. You understand that any violation of these Terms may result in potential consequences, including the possible loss or forfeiture of assets tokenized for USDsd.

You understand and agree that sending USDsd to another address automatically transfers and assigns to the owner of that address, and any subsequent owner all rights and obligations of a Holding User to redeem USDsd for approved assets so long as the Holder is or becomes a Mint User. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Holder is not a Mint User, not eligible to become a Mint User, or fails to do so, such Holding User is not entitled to redeem USDsd with Standard Money.

Standard Money (or an affiliate designated by Standard Money) commits to redeem 1 USDsd for the notional value relating to its pro rata portion of the USDsd Reserves in supported digital assets, subject to these Terms, applicable law, and any fees where applicable. While Standard Money may hold the USDsd Reserves in interest-bearing accounts or other yield-generating instruments, you acknowledge that you are not entitled to any interest or other returns earned on such funds as either a Holding User or Mint User. USDsd does not itself generate any interest or return for holders of USDsd and only represents your right to redeem USDsd as a Mint User, if you are one. If you are a Holding User, you do not have a right to redeem USDsd with Standard Money.

## 3. Applicable Laws and Regulations; AML and CTF

Your holding and use of USDsd, and any use of the USDsd Services, is subject to the laws, regulations, and rules of any applicable governmental or regulatory authority, including, without limitation, all applicable tax, anti-money laundering ("AML") and counter-terrorist financing ("CTF") provisions and sanctions.

A Restricted Person means any person that is the subject or target of any sanctions, including a person that is located, organized, or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the subject of country-wide or territory-wide sanctions, or is owned or controlled by such a person.
