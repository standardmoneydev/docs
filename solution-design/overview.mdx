## Architecture Overview

Standard Money is a synthetic dollar protocol built on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) that creates USDsd, a synthetic, collateralized version of Tether. The protocol maintains USDsd's peg through sophisticated delta-neutral hedging mechanisms and basis trading strategies.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collateral Deposit">
    Users deposit supported collateral (USDT, USDC) into the protocol
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDsd Minting">
    The protocol mints USDsd tokens backed by the deposited collateral
  </Step>
  <Step title="Basis Trading">
    The protocol automatically executes basis trades by shorting perps and
    longing spot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revenue Generation">
    Protocol earns revenue from basis trading profits and funding payments
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Distribution">
    Revenue is distributed to sUSDsd holders as rewards
  </Step>
</Steps>
