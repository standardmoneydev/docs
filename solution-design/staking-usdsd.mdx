## Overview

USDsd staking allows users to earn rewards ranging from 4-30% by staking their USDsd tokens in one of two staking pools. The protocol offers two distinct staking contracts with different reward rates and access requirements. Pool 1 is accessible to all users with any amount, while Pool 2 requires users to first stake 10 times the desired amount in Pool 1.

<Info>
  **Staking Pools**: Standard Money offers two staking pools with different
  reward rates and access requirements. Pool 1 allows any amount to be staked
  for lower rewards, while Pool 2 offers higher rewards but requires staking 10x
  the desired amount in Pool 1 first.

## Pool 1: Standard Staking Pool

### Requirements and Features

Pool 1 is designed to be accessible to all users regardless of their stake size. This pool offers standard rewards ranging from 4-15% APY and serves as the entry point for all staking activities. Users can stake any amount of USDsd tokens in this pool.

**Key Features**:

- No minimum stake requirements - stake any amount
- 4-15% APY reward range
- Cooldown period for withdrawals
- Automatic reward compounding
- Real-time balance updates
- Prerequisite for Pool 2 access

**Staking Process**: Users can deposit any amount of USDsd tokens into Pool 1 and receive sUSDsd tokens representing their staked position. Rewards are continuously accrued and automatically added to the user's sUSDsd balance, providing compound growth over time.

**Withdrawal Process**: When users wish to unstake, they must initiate a withdrawal request which triggers a cooldown period. During this cooldown, the user's position remains staked and continues to earn rewards. After the cooldown period expires, users can complete the withdrawal and receive their USDsd tokens plus accrued rewards.

## Pool 2: High Reward Staking

### Requirements and Features

Pool 2 is designed for users who want to maximize their rewards and are willing to stake larger amounts. To access Pool 2, users must first stake 10 times the desired amount in Pool 1. For example, to stake 100 USDsd in Pool 2, you must first stake 1,000 USDsd in Pool 1. This pool offers higher rewards up to 30% APY.

**Key Features**:

- Requires 10x stake in Pool 1 as prerequisite
- Up to 30% APY potential rewards
- Cooldown period for withdrawals
- Automatic reward compounding
- Real-time balance updates
- Higher reward potential for committed users

**Access Requirements**: To stake in Pool 2, you must first stake 10 times the desired amount in Pool 1. This means if you want to stake 100 USDsd in Pool 2, you need to have 1,000 USDsd staked in Pool 1. This requirement ensures that only users with significant commitment can access the higher reward pool.

**Staking Process**: Once you meet the Pool 1 requirement, you can stake the desired amount in Pool 2. You'll receive sUSDsd tokens representing your Pool 2 staked position, which will earn the higher reward rate.

**Withdrawal Process**: Similar to Pool 1, Pool 2 also requires a cooldown period for withdrawals. Users must initiate a withdrawal request and wait for the cooldown period to expire before they can complete the withdrawal and receive their USDsd tokens plus accrued rewards.

## Reward Mechanism

### How Rewards Work

Both staking pools operate on the same fundamental reward mechanism, with rewards generated from the protocol's revenue-generating activities including basis trading, liquidity provision, and other yield-generating strategies. The difference in reward rates between pools reflects the different risk profiles and capital requirements.

**Reward Sources**: Rewards are generated from the protocol's basis trading activities, liquidity provision on exchanges, and other revenue-generating strategies. These rewards are distributed proportionally to stakers based on their stake size and the pool they've chosen.

**Compounding Effect**: Rewards are automatically compounded into the user's sUSDsd balance, meaning the staked amount grows over time without requiring manual intervention. This compounding effect can significantly increase returns over longer holding periods.

**Real-time Updates**: User balances are updated in real-time as rewards accrue, providing transparency and allowing users to track their earnings continuously.

## Withdrawal and Cooldown

### Cooldown Period

Both staking pools implement a cooldown period for withdrawals to ensure protocol stability and prevent rapid capital outflows that could impact the protocol's operations. The cooldown period applies to all withdrawal requests regardless of the pool.

**Cooldown Process**: When a user initiates a withdrawal, their position enters a cooldown period during which they cannot complete the withdrawal. During this time, their position continues to earn rewards, and they remain a participant in the staking pool.

**Cooldown Duration**: The specific cooldown duration may vary based on protocol parameters and can be adjusted through governance. Users will be informed of the current cooldown period before initiating withdrawals.

**Withdrawal Completion**: After the cooldown period expires, users can complete their withdrawal and receive their original USDsd tokens plus all accrued rewards. The withdrawal can be completed at any time after the cooldown period without additional waiting.

## Risk Considerations

### Pool Selection Risks

Choosing between Pool 1 and Pool 2 involves different risk considerations. Pool 1 offers standard rewards with no barriers to entry, making it accessible to all users. Pool 2 offers higher potential rewards but requires significant capital commitment (10x stake in Pool 1) and may have different risk profiles.

**Market Risk**: Both pools are subject to market risks including changes in reward rates, protocol performance, and overall market conditions. Users should carefully consider their risk tolerance when selecting a pool.

**Liquidity Risk**: The cooldown period means users cannot immediately access their staked funds, which could impact their liquidity needs. Users should ensure they can afford to have their funds locked during the cooldown period.

**Protocol Risk**: Both pools are subject to protocol risks including smart contract risk, operational risk, and other risks associated with the Standard Money protocol. Users should review the comprehensive risk documentation before staking.

## Best Practices

### Staking Strategy

Users should carefully consider their staking strategy based on their financial situation, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs. Pool 1 is suitable for all users regardless of stake size, while Pool 2 is better for users with significant capital who want to maximize rewards and are willing to stake 10x the amount in Pool 1 first.

**Diversification**: Users may choose to stake in both pools to diversify their exposure and balance risk and reward. This approach can provide exposure to different reward rates while managing overall risk. Remember that Pool 2 requires 10x stake in Pool 1 as a prerequisite.

**Long-term Perspective**: Staking is designed for users with a long-term perspective who can benefit from the compounding effect of rewards over time. Users should consider their investment horizon when deciding to stake.

**Regular Monitoring**: Users should regularly monitor their staked positions, reward accrual, and any changes to protocol parameters that might affect their staking experience.
