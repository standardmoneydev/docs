## Overview

Position cooldown and unlocking is a key feature of the Standard Money protocol that allows users to secure their USDsd and sUSDsd positions while maintaining flexibility for strategic trading and risk management. This guide covers everything you need to know about managing positions in cooldown.

## What are Positions in Cooldown?

Positions in cooldown in the Standard Money protocol refer to USDsd or sUSDsd tokens that have been temporarily secured and cannot be transferred or traded for a specified period. This mechanism provides several benefits including enhanced security, potential reward bonuses, and strategic position management.

When you put a position in cooldown, your tokens remain in your wallet but are marked as locked in the protocol's smart contracts. During the cooldown period, you cannot transfer, trade, or unstake these tokens, but they continue to earn rewards if they are sUSDsd tokens.

## Types of Positions in Cooldown

### USDsd Cooldown

USDsd tokens can be put in cooldown to secure your position and potentially earn additional rewards. USDsd in cooldown maintains its value and can be unlocked after the specified period. This is useful for users who want to commit to holding USDsd for a specific timeframe.

### sUSDsd Cooldown

sUSDsd tokens can also be put in cooldown, and they continue to earn rewards during the cooldown period. sUSDsd in cooldown may earn bonus rewards depending on the cooldown duration and current protocol parameters. This is ideal for users who want to maximize their yield while committing to a longer-term position.

## How to Put Positions in Cooldown

### Step-by-Step Cooldown Process

1. **Connect Your Wallet**

   - Ensure you have MetaMask or another compatible wallet connected
   - Make sure you have sufficient BSC for gas fees
   - Verify you have USDsd or sUSDsd tokens to put in cooldown

2. **Navigate to Cooldown Interface**

   - Go to the Standard Money app
   - Find the "Cooldown Positions" section
   - Select the type of token you want to put in cooldown (USDsd or sUSDsd)

3. **Select Cooldown Duration**

   - Choose from available cooldown periods (typically 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year)
   - Review the potential bonus rewards for each duration
   - Consider your investment timeline and risk tolerance

4. **Enter Amount for Cooldown**

   - Specify the amount of USDsd or sUSDsd you want to put in cooldown
   - Review the cooldown terms and conditions
   - Confirm you understand the cooldown period and restrictions

5. **Confirm the Transaction**
   - Review all details carefully
   - Approve the transaction in your wallet
   - Wait for confirmation on the blockchain

### Cooldown Duration Options

The protocol typically offers several cooldown duration options, each with different benefits:

- **1 Week**: Short-term commitment with minimal bonus rewards
- **1 Month**: Moderate commitment with small bonus rewards
- **3 Months**: Medium-term commitment with moderate bonus rewards
- **6 Months**: Long-term commitment with significant bonus rewards
- **1 Year**: Maximum commitment with highest bonus rewards

## How to Unlock Positions

### Automatic Unlocking

Most positions in cooldown unlock automatically when the cooldown period expires. Once unlocked, your tokens return to their normal state and can be transferred, traded, or unstaked as usual. You will receive a notification when your position is ready to unlock.

### Manual Unlocking (If Available)

Some positions may allow for early unlocking with penalties or fees. If this option is available:

1. **Navigate to Your Positions**

   - Go to the "My Positions" section in the app
   - Find your position in cooldown
   - Check if early unlock is available

2. **Review Unlock Terms**

   - Understand any penalties or fees for early unlocking
   - Calculate the net benefit of early unlock
   - Consider waiting for automatic unlock if penalties are significant

3. **Initiate Early Unlock**
   - Click the "Unlock Early" button if available
   - Confirm you understand the penalties
   - Approve the transaction in your wallet

## Benefits of Cooldown Positions

### Enhanced Security

Putting positions in cooldown provides an additional layer of security by preventing unauthorized transfers or trades. This is particularly valuable for users who want to protect their positions from potential security breaches or impulsive trading decisions.

### Bonus Rewards

Positions in cooldown often earn bonus rewards compared to unlocked positions. The longer the cooldown period, the higher the potential bonus rewards. This incentivizes long-term commitment to the protocol and provides additional yield for patient investors.

### Strategic Position Management

Cooldown allows for strategic position management, helping users stick to their investment plans and avoid emotional trading decisions. It's particularly useful for users who want to commit to a specific investment timeline.

## Risks and Considerations

### Liquidity Risk

The primary risk of putting positions in cooldown is reduced liquidity. Once in cooldown, you cannot access your tokens until the cooldown period expires (or until early unlock with penalties). This means you cannot respond to market opportunities or emergencies that might require immediate access to your funds.

### Market Risk

During the cooldown period, market conditions may change significantly. If you need to exit your position due to changing market conditions, you may be unable to do so without penalties, potentially resulting in losses.

### Early Unlock Penalties

If early unlock is available, it typically comes with penalties that can significantly reduce your returns. These penalties are designed to discourage early unlocking and maintain the integrity of the cooldown mechanism.

## Best Practices

### Choose Appropriate Cooldown Duration

Select a cooldown duration that aligns with your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Don't put positions in cooldown for longer than you're comfortable with, as this could limit your flexibility in changing market conditions.

### Diversify Your Strategy

Consider putting only a portion of your holdings in cooldown, keeping some tokens unlocked for flexibility. This allows you to benefit from cooldown rewards while maintaining some liquidity for opportunities or emergencies.

### Monitor Your Positions

Regularly check your positions in cooldown and their unlock dates. Set reminders for when positions are about to unlock so you can make informed decisions about whether to put them back in cooldown or unlock.

### Understand the Terms

Before putting any position in cooldown, thoroughly understand the terms, including cooldown duration, bonus rewards, early unlock penalties, and any other relevant conditions.

## Troubleshooting

### Position Not Showing as in Cooldown

If your position doesn't appear as in cooldown after the transaction:

- Wait for additional blockchain confirmations
- Refresh the page or reconnect your wallet
- Check the transaction hash on BSCScan
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Unable to Unlock Position

If you cannot unlock a position when expected:

- Verify the cooldown period has actually expired
- Check if there are any pending transactions
- Ensure you have sufficient BSC for gas fees
- Contact support for assistance

### Missing Rewards

If you're not receiving expected rewards on sUSDsd in cooldown:

- Verify the position is actually in cooldown
- Check current protocol reward rates
- Ensure the cooldown duration qualifies for bonus rewards
- Review the reward calculation methodology
